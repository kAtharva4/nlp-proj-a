**Project Title:**
**Sentiment Detection in Customer Support Interactions**

**Project Abstract:**

In today’s digital age, customer service interactions are rapidly growing, and effectively managing them has become a challenge for organizations. With the increasing volume and diversity of support communications, manually prioritizing and responding to customer queries is inefficient and often leads to delayed resolutions. This project addresses these challenges by developing an automated sentiment detection system that classifies customer support interactions into three key categories: frustrated, satisfied, and neutral. By leveraging advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and state-of-the-art machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) models—including transformer-based architectures like BERT—the system is designed to accurately capture and interpret the nuanced sentiments embedded in text data.

**Algorithms Used:**

**Machine Learning Algorithms:**

 - Logistic Regression
 - Support Vector Machine (SVM)
 - Random Forest Classifier


**Deep Learning Algorithms:**

 - Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)
 - Bilstm
 - Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)

**Language Models:**
 - Roberta
 - BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers)
   
**Comparative Analysis:**

The comparative analysis of different models highlights their effectiveness in classifying news articles into the correct category. The following table summarizes the accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score of the models tested:

|Model Type|Accuracy (%)|Precision (%)|Recall (%)|F1-Score (%)|
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
|logistic Regression|96.4|96.41|96.4|96.4|
|Random Forest|99.3|99.3|99.3|99.3|
|Support Vector Machine|94.7|94.73|94.7|94.71|
|BERT|87|86|85|85|
|Robert|91|90|89|90|

|Model Type|Training Epochs|Final Trainig Accuracy|Final validation Accuracy|Convergence Speed|
| --- | --- |--- |--- | --- |
|Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)|10|0.6685|1.0000|Fast|
|Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)|12|0.4695|0.7613|Medium|
|Bilstm|15|~0.35|0.75|Slow|

**Conclusion:**

In an era where customer service interactions are rapidly increasing, the need for efficient sentiment detection has become more critical than ever. This project successfully addresses the challenges of manual query classification by implementing an automated sentiment detection system that categorizes interactions into frustrated, satisfied, and neutral sentiments. By leveraging advanced NLP techniques and state-of-the-art ML and DL models, including transformer-based architectures like BERT, the system enhances the accuracy of sentiment classification, ensuring timely and effective customer support responses.

Through a comparative analysis of various sentiment classification approaches, this study highlights the strengths and limitations of different models, particularly in handling noisy and unstructured data. Despite the challenges, the findings demonstrate the potential of deep learning in improving sentiment detection performance. Future enhancements, such as integrating multilingual support and real-time analysis, will further extend the system’s applicability, making it a valuable tool for organizations striving to optimize their customer service operations.
